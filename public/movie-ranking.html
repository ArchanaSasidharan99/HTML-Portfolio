<h3>3 idiots</h3>

<p>Three Idiots is a groundbreaking Bollywood hit that was released ahead of its time. This film is a comedy with great acting, unique characters, a complex plot, and, most importantly, a very inspiring film about choosing the correct route in life.</p>
<p>The film's makers depicted some breathtaking views of Ladakh's rugged environment. These sequences were captured using a variety of camera angles, including high angle, crane, and parallax views. These bright images were cleverly employed to suggest that a pleasant and exciting event was on the way. I thought the video was highly informative in the manner it seeks to raise awareness and educate viewers about the rising danger of suicides in India's school system. The tone of the picture shifts quickly from joyful to sorrowful to funny, and so on. As a result, the picture became more exciting since I was continually on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what intriguing incident would unfold. I used to believe that all Bollywood films were low-budget and had bad performers, but I've since learned that some of their actors are very convincing, even by Hollywood standards! These acting talents have inspired me to watch more Bollywood films since they have shown me how exceptional they can be. </p>
<p>Overall, ‘Three Idiots' was a wonderful film that showed me just how good Bollywood films can be. My emotions were like a roller coaster throughout the movie, ranging from sorrowful to ecstatic in a matter of seconds. I would suggest this film to everyone hesitant to watch a Bollywood film, but I would also recommend it to everyone else on the planet.</p>

<h3>Bombay</h3>

<p>Can you imagine the first half of any film is a clichéd tale swooning with delight while the other half screams fanaticism and bloodshed in each shell? "Bombay" is all about the aesthetics in the beginning but it makes you all jittery and twitchy without even realizing it. What startles me the most is the proficiency of Mani Ratnam to fuse everything from one platter and deliver it without any bias. Each frame of "Bombay" is divine and daunting at the same time. </p>
<p>Nothing beats the rawness and the bizarre simplicity of this film. I watched "Bombay" in Tamil and nothing else could have made me happier than to see its wholesomeness. Each song in this film is a melodic treat to the heart. These are not just mere songs but a mellifluous conversation between the characters that conveys each emotion through its rhythm. Music always narrates a story. You just need to listen to it properly.</p>

<h3>Thanmathra</h3>

<p>Thanmaatra is the best movie from India to attempt at Alzimers disease. Everyone from that lil kid to the lead was cherry picked for the roles they'd played. I love the way the movie glows. From the normal life of a middle-class man elwho enjoys the smallest of things to a person suffering from never Alzimers disease. Director Blessy, made sure that the audience stayed connected to all the events and happenings which worked very well so that we wept when they did, laughed alongside and had aheavy heart for the losses they'd suffered.</p>
<p>How can anyone do this justice to a role? Mohanlal is out of the world. I just cannot imagine a person better suited to the role than him. The movie has a perfect cast and there's nothing you can do to improvise. Mohanlal, once again proved himself to be the greatest actor of all time, by living the role he was given. He was so convincing that when ever he cried , I saw my entire family weeping alongside him. One of the brilliant performances from him</p>
